       "'This used to be one of my favorite restaurants but the service went way down hill.  The new owners hire lots of college students with tattoos everywhere as well as lots of piercings.  Seems like tattoos and too many piercings are a job requirement along with disrespect and a lack of desire.  The staff is what made this place the worst restaurant ever and doesnt seem to matter how often you let management know I just dont think they care.  Also in the past few years there is a growing number of homeless that sit out front begging for money.  They sit so close to the outside patio that you have them dining with you or at least it feels that way making you incredibly uncomfortable.  Our last visit we sat on the patio which was next to a bench just outside the restaurant where a few homeless were stationed.  One girl had a huge rat on her shoulder and it was beyond disgusting.  Management obviously doesnt care and does nothing to improve anything so we go way out of our way now to eat at the other Greek in Chandler at Chandler Mall.'"

Then they tried to hit me up for add-ons such as fuel injector cleaning for $50 (they say it will help my mpg.... sounds nice).  I\\'m no automotive dunce so I asked what they do, he informed me they put a cleaning agent in your fuel tank that cleans your injectors.... you know those cleaning agents they sell at automotive stores for $1.99-5.99... \\n\\nA little perturbed with the service I had received I get into my car to leave, and as I sit down I see dead bugs still on my windshield, and dust on my dash board.... you know the stuff I had just payed to get cleaned....
